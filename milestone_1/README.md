Milestone 1: Dataset & Linear Classifier

Dataset:
The dataset that we chose to use comprises of metadata about articles posted to mashable.com.  Also included is the amount of shares that each article received in social media.  The intended goal of analyzing this data is to create a model that can predict which articles will go viral, i.e. predict how many shares an article will get.  

See description.csv for descriptive statitics about the dataset

See linear.csv for output and statistics of a linear regression classifier, including 10-fold cross-validation

Analysis was done using python, numpy, and sklearn
Run analysis with `python3 analysis.py`
